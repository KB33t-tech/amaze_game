	Example:  mvn -Dtest=TestWallDetection test  
	
5. Run an individual unit test(method) in a specific class:  
	Step 1:	mvn -Dtest=xxxxxx#testA test	(xxxxxx is class name, testA is method name)  
	Example:  mvn -Dtest=TestWallDetection#testRightWall test  
	
6. Run all the integration tests in all classes:  
	Step 1:	mvn verify
